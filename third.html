    <p>
        If covid-19 wasn't enough to make 2020 terrible there were also many riots around may started by the killing of George Floyd.
        Cops wrongfully killed a man named Geoege Floyd on video and it spread all over the country. Riots and raids started on businesses
        that had nothing to do with the death. Black Lives Matter (BLM) was comming back stronger than ever. Mind you these gatherings
        were still happening during the pandemic.
