       2020 had many unexpected events to come to us but we needed to use this year to learn and adapt. We were no prepared at all for 
       all these events. When the riots were happening we were not prepared. When the election came around we actually saw stores boarding
       up stores preparing for the worst of the election. Since the beginning of the year it has gotten better and we have gotten a vaccine
       for the desease hopefully ending the pandemic.
