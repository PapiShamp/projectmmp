        It all started fine when the clock striked 12 and it is finally 2020 everything was fine and there were few cases of covid
        not in U.S. so Trump was not worried about it and that was our first mistake. Trusting him into protecting us from this and now 
        it moneths later we are still in this pandemic. In march we will go into one of the worst times we have ever lived where schools are closing
        as well as other businessess.
