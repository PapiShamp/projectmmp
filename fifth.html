        What makes 2020 even worse is that even with the pandemic, all these movements and deaths we had our presidental election coming up.
        With the BLM and ALM dividing our country the election had our country even more divided. Everyone wanted to know if you were democrat
        or republican. With Trump failing to warn us about covid and the trump supporters who believed that covid wasnt real really hurt Trumps
        campaign and gave Biden the win. With all the porblems that 2020 gave to America put Biden in a really hot seat.
