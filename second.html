        After the cases were spiking we all got into quarantine mode. Everyone has to stay inside because of covid-19. At first in my 
        march and april it was rumored to only have to quarantine for a couple weeks at max months but we are still here. Schools are closed
        no indoor dinig again and everyone still has to wear masks.
