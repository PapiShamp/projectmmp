        Even with all this going there were many deaths. In the beginning of the year even before the pandemic we lost Kobe bryant 
        and his daughter Gianna Bryant due to a helicopter crash. In that event the world felt still and we knew something more was heppening.
        Chadwick Boseman also died recently due to a long battle with cancer. Alex Trebek who also had a battle with cancer and ultimatley 
        lost this year. The list goes on and on but we would have to be here all day
