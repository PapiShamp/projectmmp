    <h2>By Andrew Echeverria</h2>
    <p>Short paragraph introducing the story. What is it about? Why did you make it? If it is related to a political/social cause, how would you summarize the message you are trying to convey?</p>

    <p>My story is about life for most of us this year. For most of us our age we have never seen a such an eventful year like this one.
      Of course there were other eventful things in history but this is like the first big thing I have seen with my own eyes. Theres things 
      from covid to protests to peoples deaths to presidental campaigns.
